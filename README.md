Implemented K-Means Clustering and Fisher’s LDA to detect fraudulent transactions using real-world credit card data. Selected ‘Amount’ and ‘Time’ as key features, applied Min-Max Scaling, and determined the optimal clusters using the Elbow Method. Trained Fisher’s LDA for fraud classification, achieving high accuracy with clear decision boundaries.
